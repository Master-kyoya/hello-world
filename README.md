# hello-world

Hi there!

Kyoya here, I am a Student of BSIT (Just exploring things about programming since I'm gonna deal with this in college).

I love music I usually play guitar when I'm stressed out so that i could somehow release the stress that I carry.

Also, I start learning the basics of Java.

WISH ME LUCK!
